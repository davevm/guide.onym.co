This guide is an on-going open source attempt to organize the best
tools and resources for naming things. If you’re looking for help on
naming a project, we also take on clients [here](https://onym.co).

If you find the site useful, consider joining our mailing list below
where we’ll send occasional thoughts and additional resources on
naming. And if you see something that would be a good addition to the
site, submit an edit via
[Github](https://github.com/onymco/guide.onym.co) or [drop us a
line](mailto: contact@onym.co).

Thanks, [Greg](https://twitter.com/leppert) + [Willem](https://twitter.com/vanlancker)
