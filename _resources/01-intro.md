This guide is an on-going open source attempt to organized the best
tools and resources for naming things. We wrote a short essay
[here](http://example.com) and also take on some clients
[here](http://example.com).

If you find the site useful, consider joining our mailing list below
where weâ€™ll send occasional thoughts and additional resources on
naming. And if you see something that would be a good addition to the
site, submit an edit via
[Github](https://github.com/onymco/guide.onym.co) or [drop us a
line](mailto: contact@onym.co).
